# GNSS Time Series Viewers

## Overview:
This library contains a set of tools to read GNSS time series and velocities, remove earthquake/antenna offsets, solve for slopes, remove seasonal terms using several algorithms, and plot time series, stacks, and maps.  It can read data from the University of Nevada Reno (.tenv3) format, the Plate Boundary Observatory / Network Of The Americas (.pos) format, and the USGS format (.rneu).


## Dependencies and Installation
The easiest way to install this repository is to use pip. An example of the pip workflow:

1. Git clone this library onto your local machine.  
2. From the top-level directory, in your preferred Python environment, run ```pip install .``` 

This library requires the Python packages listed in requirements.txt. 
If not using pip, you can alternately create a new Conda environment using requirements.txt, or you can manually ensure that you have each of those libraries installed.
Don't forget the following libraries: [tectonic_utils](https://github.com/kmaterna/Tectonic_Utils), 
and the [Earthscope CLI](https://gitlab.com/earthscope/public/earthscope-cli) for downloading Earthscope time series.


## Accessing Prerequisite GNSS Data
This library requires you to create a local copy of your desired GNSS time series, velocities, steps, offsets, and/or hydrological loading models from 
at least one GNSS database. Each GNSS data source is slightly different.  The file ```gnss_timeseries_viewers/getting_gnss_data/metadata.txt``` describes how to locate and download these files.
Remember that Earthscope now requires a log-in and the Earthscope-CLI for wget access.  
 

The script ```gnss_timeseries_viewers/getting_gnss_data/update_data_holdings.sh``` now automates the download of many repositories locally, which might take 
a few hours (and ~10Gb) if you're downloading every time series from every processing center.  See specific scripts for individual databases that you might want.  

## Configuration

So, you've got some GNSS data onto your system. Now, to organize it and pass it into the library. An example file structure after running several scripts above might look like this:

```commandline 
├── Earthscope_Data
│   ├── Offsets/
│   ├── Earthscope_Event_Files/
│   ├── Time_Series/
│   ├── Velocities/
│   ├── cwu_config.txt
│   ├── nmt_config.txt
│   └── pbo_config.txt
├── UNR_Data
│   ├── Offsets/
│   ├── Time_Series/
│   ├── Velocities/
│   ├── UNR_coords_current.txt
│   └── unr_config.txt
├── USGS_Data
│   ├── Metadata/
│   ├── Offsets/
│   ├── Time_Series/
│   ├── Velocities/
│   └── usgs_config.txt
└── config.txt
```
With these directories on your system, you need to create a **VERY IMPORTANT** configuration file ```config.txt``` that tells the library where to find each GNSS data source.
In this case, ```config.txt``` contains something like the following:

```commandline 
# Example Config file for velocities, time series, and offsets
#############################################
# 
[py-config]

gps_data_dir = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_Data/
pbo_config = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_DATA/Earthscope_Data/pbo_config.txt
cwu_config = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_DATA/Earthscope_Data/cwu_config.txt
nmt_config = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_DATA/Earthscope_Data/nmt_config.txt
unr_config = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_DATA/UNR_Data/unr_config.txt
usgs_config = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_DATA/USGS_Data/usgs_config.txt
hydro_config = /Users/Path/to/../GPS_POS_DATA/Hydro/hydro_config.txt
```

Each of the inner config files contain relative filepaths to each database (see templates in the ```examples/``` directory). 
Please follow a similar templates for your own system. The path to the ```config.txt``` file will be passed into the library each time you use it.


## Library Features:
From this library, one can:
* Download local copies of GNSS velocities, time series, and offsets from the UNR, Earthscope, and USGS databases.
* Plot single GNSS time series (3-component)
* Read time series and velocities from UNR, PBO, CWU, and NMT formats
* Extract offsets at the times of earthquakes and antenna changes
* Remove seasonal terms using:
    * Least Squares fitting to a model with sines and cosines at 12-month and 6-month periods
    * A notch filter with notches at 12-month and 6-month periods
    * NLDAS, a high-resolution soil moisture and hydrological loading model for North America provided by UNAVCO
    * GLDAS, a medium-resolution soil moisture and hydrological loading model for North America provided by UNAVCO
    * LSDM, a high-resolution surface water and hydrological loading model globally provided by GFZ
* Plot stacks of time series
* Manually exclude bad stations from stacks if they are on the user-defined blacklist
* Calculate the formal velocity uncertainty and an empirical uncertainty on velocity estimates using the Allen Variance of the Rate (Hackl et al., 2011)
* Write out processed time series as text files in .pos format
* Create more complex experiments with GNSS time series (custom offsets, custom stacks, etc.)
* Specify the configuration of your system and the location of the local GNSS data with a plain-text config file, passed into the library each time it is used.

## Examples

### Example 1: How many stations within a region?
Using one function, we can figure out which stations in the PBO newtwork are within a certain radius or region. In this example, we read the PBO stations and return any within 100 km of a chosen coordinate.
```bash
example $ python example_driver_find_within_radius.py 
Reading /Users/path/to/Velocity_Files/NAM08_pbovelfile_feb2018.txt
Returning 26 stations that are within 100.000 km of center -122.0000, 40.0000
['ORVB', 'P270', 'P272', 'P333', 'P334', 'P335', 'P336', 'P337', 'P339', 'P341', 'P344', 'P345', 'P346', 
'P349', 'P664', 'P665', 'P666', 'P667', 'P668', 'P669', 'P670', 'P671', 'P794', 'QUIN', 'SUTB', 'WDCB']
```


### Example 2: Single GNSS Time Series
As another example, we plot the PBO time series of P511, a station in Southern California with seasonal terms and antenna changes removed but earthquakes still left in. One possible usage of one driver is illustrated and its command-line outputs are shown.
```bash
example $ python example_driver_single_plot.py P511
------- P511 --------
Viewing station P511, earthquakes_remove=0, outliers_remove=1, seasonals_remove=1, datasource=cwu, refframe=NA

### Example 3: A GNSS Stack
We can also plot a list of GNSS time series as a stack.  An example is shown below for stations in the northern San Francisco Bay Area. The parameters can be set in ```example_driver_stack.py```.  You can select which kinds of plots you want, whether it's vertical, horizontal, filtered, earthquakes removed, etc.

You can make a simple map of the stations in your region:
